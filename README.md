# Reverser
Reverse the order of words in a line of text
## Setup
* nodejs should be installed
* run `npm install` in project root directory
## How to use
There are two ways to run. In a terminal from the project root:
* run `node src/main.js pathToSomeInputFile`
* `npm run test` to view the test results that use test input files included in the project

## Input file format:
The first line of input gives the number of cases, N. N test cases follow. For each test case there will a line of letters and space characters indicating a list of space separated words. Spaces will not appear at the start or end of a line.

Example file contents:
```

all you base
```
